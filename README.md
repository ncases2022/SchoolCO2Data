# Project Principles
- **Honest Limitations**: We are parents, not air quality experts. We read scientific papers, coordinate with experts (multiple Ph.D.'s have consulted with us), and do our best to be true to the science. At the same time, we do not proport to be experts, and we hope schools will perform their own air quality measurements with a proper expert. 
- **Integrity**: We provide parents with a trustworthy sensor (primarily the Aranet 4), train them on taking CO2 readings, and then cross-check the data according to the parent notes and the school calendar. If we have any hesitations or questions about the accuracy of the data, we don't include it in our repository. 
- **Transparency**: We coordinate with parents to take measurements in schools. We don't censor any CO2 measurements -- whether positive, negative, or neutral. We do our best to validate that CO2 measurements are taking according to our instructions to ensure an accurate reading.

## Project History
- 10/3/2022: First version of data published.
- 10/11/2022: Added autogenerated graphs for each data file using 800 PPM guideline from CDC. See R file for graph script or each PNG along side each CSV file.
- 10/11/2022: Added additional WCPSS elementary school in District 9.
- 10/19/2022: Added media mentions and Twitter handle
    - Added WCPSSS district measurement from Scott's Ridge and changed WCPDD folders to differentiate parents measurements from school measurements. 
    - Added parent readings for 4 days in District 8 middle school.
    - Updated R graph script for speed (skipping already made graphs).
- 10/20/2022: Switched Elem02 in District 6 to Elem04 in District 9.
